## Project

- Used React-boilerplate
  - React boilerplater lets me quickly create components, containers, routes with redux, routing already setup.
  - Since redux and routing are setup I do not have to put much time and worry to set them up
  - Easily lets me create new test cases
  - Easily lets me code style, code format without putting any wasting my time on that.
  - React boiler plate lets you use the app even without network connection
  - In conclusion I think react-boilerplate saved me a lot of time during the app setup
- Searching
  - The search is dynamic so every time the user enters something in the search bar the results update
  - If the data were to update after the search the results would update as well.
  - React let me do dynamic updates pretty easily without putting much time into ti
  - For searching I simply using a array filter and passed the data I got from the filter to a component to display
  - I simply used array maps when there were was an array in the data
- Components
  - Since I was using react I wanted to split as many things into a component as I could to allow for reusabilty. I created components for different data cards, tags, and the search bar itself
- Style
  - I simply used bootstrap as it is lightweight and easy to use, added some custom styling in places just to give it a unique feel
  - Used React-Icon as it is a huge collection of icons and easy to use
- Advanced Feature
  - The one advanced feature I implemented were dynamic result update when the data were to update.
  - Though I wanted to add the pin, delete, add tag features I found myself short of time

Thank you for considering me to be a engineer at your company, whatever the result may be I am sure I can learn a lot from this process.
